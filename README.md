_A Simple Ionic Tutorial_

At [ebookcraft  2017](http://techforum.booknetcanada.ca/ebookcraft/) I walked a room full of ebook developers on how to build cross-platform apps using the languages they already know: HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is the app we built.

# Usage

This app is the result of the workshop from Ebookcraft 2017. I've published the text of my talk so you can walk through it and build it for yoursef! Dependencies and requirements are also explained in detail in this [article](http://www.booknetcanada.ca/blog/2017/1/26/all-the-tools-you-need-to-take-your-skills-beyond-ebooks).
