# App Tutorial for Ebook Developers

_An Example Ionic App_

At [ebookcraft 2017](http://techforum.booknetcanada.ca/ebookcraft/) I walked a room full of ebook developers on how to build cross-platform apps using the languages they already know: HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is the app we built.

# Usage and Dependencies

This app is the result of the workshop from Ebookcraft 2017. It is intended as a tutorial for ebook developers to build their first simple app using programming languages they are already familiar with. Dependencies and requirements are explained in detail in this [article](http://www.booknetcanada.ca/blog/2017/1/26/all-the-tools-you-need-to-take-your-skills-beyond-ebooks).

# Tutorial

The full, step by step [tutorial](tutorial.md) is a part of this repository. That way you'll always have access to it offline if you clone this repo to your machine, along with the completed app's code to refer to if you get stuck.
